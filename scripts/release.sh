# release.sh — Tag a release and push to trigger GitHub Actions release workflow
# Usage: ./scripts/release.sh <version>
# Example: ./scripts/release.sh 0.4.0
#
# This script:
# 1. Validates the version and checks we're on main
# 2. Creates a git tag (v<version>)
# 3. Pushes the tag to origin, which triggers .github/workflows/release.yml
#
# The release workflow handles: build → sign with the stable self-signed identity
# → package DMG → create GitHub Release
