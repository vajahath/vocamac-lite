## How It Works

Push-to-Talk is the default activation mode in VocaMac. It's designed to feel as natural as using a walkie-talkie: **hold to speak, release to transcribe**.

1. **Press and hold** your chosen hotkey (Right Option ⌥ by default)
2. **Speak** naturally while the key is held down
3. **Release** the key when you're done
4. **Text appears** at your cursor, wherever you're typing

The entire flow takes less than a second from release to text appearing on screen. There's no delay, no loading spinner, no waiting. Just your words, typed out.

## Why Push-to-Talk?

Most voice dictation apps use a click-to-start, click-to-stop model. That sounds simple, but in practice it creates ambiguity: *Am I recording right now? Did I forget to stop?*

Push-to-Talk eliminates that entirely:

- **No ambiguity**: if your finger is on the key, you're recording. If it's not, you're not.
- **No forgotten recordings**: release the key and recording stops automatically.
- **Instant feedback**: the menu bar icon turns green the moment you press, and returns to normal when you release.
- **Muscle memory**: after a few uses, it becomes second nature. Like holding Shift to capitalize.

## Choosing Your Hotkey

VocaMac supports a wide range of hotkeys for Push-to-Talk activation:

- **Right Option (⌥)** - the default, ergonomic and rarely used by other apps
- **Left Option (⌥)** - if you prefer the left side
- **Right Command (⌘)** - for Command-key enthusiasts
- **Right Shift (⇧)** - another good ergonomic choice
- **Right Control (⌃)** - a comfortable reach for many keyboards
- **Function keys (F5-F12)** - if you prefer dedicated keys
- **Fn key** - the function key itself

Want a key that isn't in the list? Click **Record** next to the preset picker and press any key — VocaMac captures it and shows it as your "Custom" key (press Escape to cancel). While VocaMac is running, that key is reserved for activation.

You can change your hotkey anytime in **Settings → General → Activation Key**.

## Visual Feedback

While recording, VocaMac gives you clear visual cues so you always know what's happening:

- **Menu bar icon** turns green to indicate active recording
- **Audio level indicator** shows real-time input volume in the popover
- **Cursor indicator** (optional) shows a floating mic icon near your text cursor

## Works Everywhere

Push-to-Talk works in any application that accepts text input:

- Text editors and IDEs (VS Code, Xcode, Sublime Text)
- Browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Arc)
- Communication apps (Slack, Teams, Discord)
- Productivity apps (Notes, Pages, Google Docs)
- Terminal emulators
- Email clients

VocaMac injects text at your cursor position using macOS accessibility APIs, so it works system-wide without any app-specific integrations.

## Compared to Double-Tap Toggle

VocaMac also offers a **Double-Tap Toggle** mode as an alternative. Here's how they compare:

| | Push-to-Talk | Double-Tap Toggle |
|---|---|---|
| **Activate** | Hold key | Double-tap key |
| **Deactivate** | Release key | Double-tap again |
| **Best for** | Short dictations, quick notes | Longer dictations, hands-free |
| **Risk of forgetting** | None | Possible |
| **Physical effort** | Hold key continuously | Tap twice to start/stop |

Most users prefer Push-to-Talk for its simplicity and reliability. But if you regularly dictate for more than 30 seconds at a time, Double-Tap Toggle might be more comfortable.

You can switch between modes anytime in **Settings → General → Activation Mode**.
