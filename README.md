## 🏛️ Why WhisperKit?

VocaMac uses [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) instead of raw whisper.cpp because:

| | WhisperKit | whisper.cpp |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| **Language** | Pure Swift (native) | C++ (requires bridging) |
| **Apple Silicon** | CoreML + Neural Engine | Metal only |
| **SPM Integration** | One-line dependency | Complex vendoring |
| **Model Format** | CoreML (optimized per device) | GGML (generic) |
| **Streaming** | First-class async/await | Manual threading |
| **Quality** | Same OpenAI Whisper models | Same OpenAI Whisper models |
| **Maintenance** | Argmax Inc. (commercial) | Community |

Same accuracy, dramatically better Apple platform integration.

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **macOS 13 (Ventura)** or later
- **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- **Xcode 15+** or Swift 5.9+ (only for building from source)

### Permissions

VocaMac requires three macOS permissions:

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| **Microphone** | Capture your voice for transcription |
| **Accessibility** | Global hotkeys and text injection into apps |
| **Input Monitoring** | Detect hotkey presses system-wide |

> **Note:** After granting Input Monitoring, a restart of VocaMac is required for it to take effect.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Download DMG (Recommended)

1. **Download** the latest `VocaMac-x.x.x-arm64.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocamac/releases)
2. **Open** the DMG and drag VocaMac to Applications
3. **Open** VocaMac from Applications
4. **Grant permissions**: Microphone, Accessibility, and Input Monitoring when prompted

> VocaMac is **Developer ID signed and notarized** by Apple — macOS will open it without any security warnings.

### Option 2: Build from Source (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocamac.git
cd vocamac
make install
```

This builds VocaMac, installs it to `/Applications`, and launches it. Permissions are granted directly to VocaMac, just like the DMG method.

### Option 3: CLI Commands (For Developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocamac.git
cd vocamac
make install-cli
```

This installs two commands to `~/.local/bin`:
- `vocamac &`: Launch VocaMac in background
- `vocamac-build`: Rebuild from source after pulling updates

> **Permissions note:** In CLI mode, macOS assigns permissions to your **terminal app** (Terminal, iTerm2, etc.) rather than VocaMac itself. Grant Microphone, Accessibility, and Input Monitoring to your terminal app instead.

### First Launch

1. **VocaMac appears in your menu bar** (microphone icon, no Dock icon)
2. **Grant permissions**: Microphone, Accessibility, and Input Monitoring (see [Permissions](#permissions) above)
3. **First model download**: WhisperKit automatically downloads the recommended model for your device (~40–500 MB depending on hardware)
4. **Start dictating**: Hold the **Right Option** key, speak, and release. Your words appear at the cursor!

## 🌙 Nightly Builds

Nightly builds are automated builds from the latest `main` branch, published every day at midnight UTC when there are new commits. They let you try the latest features, fixes, and improvements before they land in a stable release.

**Why use a nightly build?**

- **Early access** — Test new features days or weeks before the next stable release
- **Help improve VocaMac** — Your feedback on nightly builds catches bugs before they reach everyone
- **Fully signed & notarized** — Nightly builds are Developer ID signed and notarized by Apple, just like stable releases. No Gatekeeper warnings, no right-click workarounds

**How to install:**

1. Download the latest `VocaMac-nightly-*.dmg` from the [Nightly Release](https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocamac/releases/tag/nightly)
2. Open the DMG and drag VocaMac to Applications
3. Grant permissions when prompted (same as a stable release)

**How to identify your build:**

Nightly builds embed the date and commit SHA in the version string. Open **Settings → About** to see something like:

```
Version 0.5.0-nightly.20260414+abc1234 (Nightly)
```

This helps us pinpoint the exact code you're running if you report an issue.

**Cadence & stability:**

| | Stable Release | Nightly Build |
|---|---|---|
| **Frequency** | When ready (manual tag) | Daily at midnight UTC |
| **Source** | Tagged commit | Latest `main` branch |
| **Signed & notarized** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Stability** | Production-ready | May contain incomplete features or bugs |
| **Best for** | Daily use | Testing & early feedback |

> ⚠️ **Nightly builds may be unstable.** If you encounter issues, please [open a bug report](https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocamac/issues/new) — your feedback helps us ship better stable releases!

## 🧠 Whisper Models

VocaMac uses OpenAI Whisper models via WhisperKit's CoreML format. The app auto-detects your hardware and recommends the best model:

| Model | Parameters | Size | Speed | Quality | Best For |
|-------|-----------|------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Tiny** | 39M | ~0.4 GB | ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ | Good | Quick notes, older Macs |
| **Base** | 74M | ~0.8 GB | ⚡⚡⚡⚡ | Better | Daily use on 8GB Macs |
| **Small** | 244M | ~1.5 GB | ⚡⚡⚡ | Great | 16GB+ Apple Silicon |
| **Medium** | 769M | ~2.5 GB | ⚡⚡ | Excellent | 24GB+ for high accuracy |
| **Large v3** | 1550M | ~4.8 GB | ⚡ | Best | Maximum accuracy |

Models are downloaded automatically from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/argmaxinc/whisperkit-coreml) on first use and cached locally. Download additional models from **Settings → Models**.

### Build Commands

```bash
make install        # Build + install to /Applications (recommended)
make install-cli    # Install CLI commands to ~/.local/bin
make build          # Build .app bundle in repo root (dev iteration)
make test           # Run tests
make run            # Launch the locally built .app
make clean          # Remove build artifacts
make help           # Show all commands
```

### Uninstall

To completely remove VocaMac and all its data (downloaded models, preferences, caches):

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh
```

Use `--keep-build` to preserve build artifacts:

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh --keep-build
```

### Troubleshooting

**Reset onboarding:** To re-trigger the first-launch onboarding wizard (e.g., after an upgrade or for testing), reset the onboarding flag:

```bash
defaults delete com.vocamac.app vocamac.hasCompletedOnboarding
```

Then relaunch VocaMac. This only clears the onboarding state; all other preferences (hotkey, language, model) are preserved.

**Reset all preferences:** To start completely fresh:

```bash
defaults delete com.vocamac.app
```

**Reset permissions (troubleshooting):** If permissions appear stuck or aren't being recognized after an update, you can reset them from **Settings → Debug → Reset All Permissions**, or manually via Terminal:

```bash
tccutil reset All com.vocamac.app
```

This clears all permission entries (Microphone, Accessibility, Input Monitoring) for VocaMac. On next launch, macOS will prompt you to re-grant them. With Developer ID signing, permissions normally persist across updates — this reset is only needed for troubleshooting.

**"Update check failed (HTTP 403)" on a shared / corporate / VPN network:** VocaMac checks for new releases by calling GitHub's public REST API, which is rate-limited to **60 unauthenticated requests per hour, per source IP**. When several people share the same egress IP (common on office VPNs, NAT'd networks, or busy CI runners), that quota is collectively exhausted and GitHub returns `HTTP 403` to every client from that IP — including VocaMac.

This is **not a bug in VocaMac** and there is nothing wrong with your install. To recover:

1. Disconnect from the VPN (or switch to a different network, e.g. your phone's hotspot).
2. Open VocaMac → **Settings → About → "Check for Updates…"** and wait for it to complete.
3. Reconnect to the VPN.

After one successful check, VocaMac caches the response's `ETag` and sends it as `If-None-Match` on every subsequent request. GitHub then replies with `304 Not Modified`, which **does not count against the rate limit**, so future checks succeed even from a rate-limited IP — until a new release ships and the ETag changes (at which point one fresh `200` response per machine is needed before `304`s resume).

## 🌐 Cross-Platform

VocaMac is the macOS member of the Voca family:

| Platform | Project | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
|  Linux | [VocaLinux](https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocalinux) | ✅ Available |
|  macOS | [VocaMac](https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocamac) | 🚀 Beta |
| 🪟 Windows | [VocaWin](https://vocawin.com) | 📋 Planned |

Each platform uses native technologies for the best possible integration, while sharing the same UX patterns and Whisper model family.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Larger models require a one-time download**: VocaMac ships with the Whisper Tiny model bundled — you can dictate immediately with no internet connection. Switching to a larger model (Small, Medium, Large) requires a one-time download; all subsequent launches work fully offline.
- **macOS only**: Requires macOS 13 (Ventura) or later.
- **Permissions reset on rebuild (build-from-source only)**: When building from source without a Developer ID certificate, macOS resets Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions on every rebuild due to ad-hoc signing. Release builds are Developer ID signed so permissions persist across updates.

### Permissions and Code Signing

Release builds of VocaMac are **Developer ID signed and notarized** by Apple. Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions persist across updates — no manual re-granting required.

**For developers building from source:** If you don't have a Developer ID certificate, `build.sh` falls back to ad-hoc signing. With ad-hoc signing, macOS resets Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions on every rebuild because the CDHash changes. This is standard macOS security behavior — all open-source apps with Accessibility (Rectangle, Maccy, AltTab, etc.) have the same limitation when ad-hoc signed.

**Workarounds for ad-hoc builds:**

| Approach | How | Permissions Persist |
|---|---|---|
| **Run from Terminal** | Grant permissions to Terminal.app once, then run `make run` | ✅ Always |
| **Re-grant manually** | System Settings → Privacy & Security after each rebuild | Per rebuild |

> **💡 Developer tip:** Add your Terminal app (Terminal.app or iTerm2) to both Accessibility and Input Monitoring in System Settings. Then run VocaMac directly from Terminal. Permissions are inherited and never reset.
